\details{
From a study of 264 high school students in Brazil to examine the effect of doing synchronized movements (such as marching in step or doing synchronized dance steps) and the effect of exertion on variables, such as pain tolerance and attitudes towards others. Students were randomly assigned to activities that involved synchronized or non-synchronized movements involving high or low levels of exertion.  Pain tolerance was measured with a blood pressure cuff, going to a maximum possible reading of 300 mmHg.
